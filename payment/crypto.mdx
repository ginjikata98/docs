# Crypto Payment Guide

Dopamine Girl accepts cryptocurrency payments, which offer lower fees and faster processing compared to traditional payment methods.

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

We accept the following cryptocurrencies:

- **BNB (Binance Coin)** - Recommended for lowest transaction fees
- **ETH (Ethereum)** - Moderate fees, widely accepted
- **USDT (Tether)** - Stable value, moderate fees
- **USDC (USD Coin)** - Stable value, moderate fees
- **BTC (Bitcoin)** - Higher fees, most popular option

**Note:** BNB has the cheapest transaction fees, followed by ETH/USDT/USDC with moderate fees, then BTC with the highest fees. Stablecoins (USDT/USDC) offer price stability pegged to the US dollar.

3. Choose **"Secret phrase"** when prompted for wallet type
4. **IMPORTANT**: Backup your secret phrase to iCloud (iOS) or Google Drive (Android)

**Warning:** Never share your secret phrase with anyone. This is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose access to your device.

Choose your preferred cryptocurrency:

**Critical Warning:** Double-check the wallet address! Verify that the first 5 and last 5 characters match exactly. Sending to the wrong address will result in permanent loss of funds.

### 4. Confirm Transaction

Review the transaction details and confirm. Note the gas fee (transaction cost) before proceeding.

## Understanding Transaction Fees

The gas fee displayed near the "Gas" icon represents the network transaction cost. Important points about fees:

- Fees go to the blockchain network, not to Dopamine Girl
- Fees vary based on network congestion
- Typically lowest for BNB, moderate for ETH/USDT/USDC, and highest for BTC

## Alternative Payment Methods

If cryptocurrency payment doesn't work for you, consider these alternatives:

- **Card Payment**: Pay with Visa, PayPal, or online banking - [Card Payment Guide](./card)
- **Telegram Stars**: Pay directly through Telegram - [Telegram Payment Guide](./telegram)
- **Direct Payment**: Use our web payment portal at [dopaminegirl.com/webapp/payment/checkout](https://dopaminegirl.com/webapp/payment/checkout)

## Security Best Practices
