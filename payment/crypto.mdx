## What You'll Need

Before starting, make sure you have:

✅ **Smartphone or computer** with internet  
✅ **Payment method** (credit card, bank account, or local payment)  
✅ **Email address** for communication  
✅ **15-30 minutes** to complete the process

## Step 1: Download Trust Wallet

Trust Wallet is a popular, secure app for buying and storing cryptocurrency.

### Download the App

Visit [Trust Wallet's official website](https://trustwallet.com/download) and choose your device:

- **📱 iPhone**: Download from App Store
- **📱 Android**: Download from Google Play Store
- **💻 Desktop**: Install Chrome extension

### Set Up Your Wallet

1. **Install and open** the app
2. Select **"Create a new wallet"**
3. Choose **"Secret phrase"** as wallet type
4. **🚨 CRITICAL**: Backup your secret phrase to iCloud (iOS) or Google Drive (Android)

**⚠️ WARNING**: Your secret phrase is like the master key to your wallet. NEVER share it with anyone. This is the ONLY way to recover your wallet if you lose your phone.

## Step 2: Buy Cryptocurrency

### Navigate to Buy Section

In Trust Wallet, tap the **"Buy"** button.

### Choose Your Cryptocurrency

Pick based on your priorities:

- **💰 Want lowest fees**: Choose **BNB**
- **💵 Want stable price**: Choose **USDT** or **USDC**
- **🔵 Want popular option**: Choose **ETH**
- **🟠 Want Bitcoin**: Choose **BTC** (highest fees)

### Select Payment Method

Choose how you want to pay:

- **💳 Credit/Debit Card** - Most common
- **🏦 Bank Transfer** - Usually cheaper fees
- **🌍 Local payment methods** - Varies by country

### Choose Provider

Trust Wallet will show you different providers. **MoonPay** is usually the most reliable and cost-effective.

**💡 Tip**: If one provider doesn't work, try another. If 2-3 providers fail, your bank might be blocking crypto purchases (call them to allow it).

## Step 3: Request Payment Address

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Verify Address

**Before sending, always check**:

2. **Check the gas fee** (network cost)

4. **Save transaction ID** for your records

## Understanding Fees

When you send crypto, you'll see a "gas fee" or "network fee":

- **💰 What it is**: Cost to process transaction on the blockchain
- **💸 Who gets it**: The blockchain network (not us)
- **📊 Fee amounts**: BNB < ETH/USDT/USDC < BTC
- **⏰ Why it varies**: Based on network traffic (like highway tolls during rush hour)

**💡 Tip**: Fees are usually lower during weekends and off-peak hours.

### 💸 **High Fees**

- **Try BNB**: Usually has lowest fees
