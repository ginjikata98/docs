## Recommended Payment Method

**Important**: Before starting, we recommend trying the **Web or Desktop version first** as it's cheaper - you won't have to pay the 30% Google/Apple fee that applies to mobile app purchases.

### Platform Links

- **Telegram Web**: [web.telegram.org](https://web.telegram.org/)
- **Telegram Desktop**: [desktop.telegram.org](https://desktop.telegram.org/)

**Note**: Web and Desktop payments only work in certain countries. If they don't work for you, follow the mobile app guide below.
