# Terms of Service

## Welcome to Dopamine Girl!

We provide a cloud-based platform (Platform) where you can create images and videos by leveraging our generative AI technologies.

These Terms form our contract with you, and set out our obligations as a service provider and your obligations as a customer. You cannot use our Services unless you agree to these Terms.

Some capitalised words in these Terms have defined meanings, and each time that word is used in these Terms it has the same meaning. You can find a list of the defined words and their meaning at the end of these Terms.

8.3     If you are on one of our paid Subscriptions (Paid Subscriber), as between the Parties, subject to your compliance with these Terms, ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights in any Content you, or your Authorised Users, create while using the Platform will vest in you upon creation, and to the extent that ownership of such Intellectual Property Rights does not automatically vest in you, we hereby assign all such Intellectual Property Rights to you and agree to do all other things necessary to assure your title in such rights.

8.4     Certain Paid Subscribers can select whether Content is public or private. You acknowledge and agree that Content marked public (Public Content) will be available for use by all users on the Platform. Where you opt for Content to be private (Private Content), only you and your Authorised Users can access that Content. Whether or not a Paid Subscriber and their Authorised Users can select whether Content is public or private is set out in your Subscription plan.

8.5     You grant us a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide, non-sublicensable (other than to our related bodies corporate, as that term is defined in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)) and non-transferable right and licence to use any Private Content solely for the purpose of performing of our obligations or exercising our rights under these Terms. We will not use, retain, analyse, or process your Inputs for any other purpose, including training AI models, developing new offerings, or for any commercial purpose, without your express written consent.

## 9.      Ownership of Services, Platform and Data

9.1     We own all intellectual property rights in our Services (including our Platform). This includes how our Platform looks and functions, as well as our copyrighted works, trademarks, inventions, designs and other intellectual property, including Our Materials. You agree not to copy or otherwise misuse our intellectual property without our written permission (for example, to reverse engineer or discover the source code of our intellectual property), and you must not alter or remove any confidentiality, copyright or other ownership notice placed on our Platform. Nothing in these Terms constitutes a transfer or assignment of any Intellectual Property Rights in Our Materials.

9.2     Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, we will own all Intellectual Property Rights in any developments, modifications, enhancements or improvements to the Platform or Our Materials (Platform Developments). To the extent that any Platform Developments do not automatically vest in us by operation of law, you hereby assign all Intellectual Property Rights in such Platform Developments to us and agree to do all other things necessary to assure our title in such rights.

9.3     We grant you a non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free, worldwide, non-sublicensable and non-transferable right and licence, for the duration of the Subscription Period, to use Our Materials that we provide to you solely for your use and enjoyment of our Services, as contemplated by these Terms.

9.5     When you use our Services, we may create anonymised statistical data from your usage of our Services (for example, through aggregation). Once anonymised, we own that data and may use it for our own purposes, such as to provide and improve our Services, to develop new services or product offerings, to identify business trends, and for other uses we communicate to you. This may include making such anonymised data publicly available, provided it is not compiled using a sample size small enough to make your data or identity identifiable.

## 10.     Confidential Information and Personal Information

10.1    While using our Services, you may share confidential information with us, and you may become aware of confidential information about us. You agree not to use our confidential information, and to take reasonable steps to protect our confidential information from being disclosed without our permission, and we agree to do the same for your confidential information. This also means making sure that any Authorised Users, employees, contractors, professional advisors or agents of ours or yours only have access to confidential information on a 'need-to-know basis' (in other words, the disclosure is absolutely necessary), and that they also agree to not misuse or disclose such confidential information.

10.2    However, either you or we may share confidential information with legal or regulatory authorities if required by law to do so.

10.3    We collect, hold and disclose and use any Personal Information you provide to us in accordance with our privacy policy, available on our website, and applicable privacy laws.

10.4    You must only disclose Personal Information to us if you have the right to do so (such as having the individual's express consent).

10.5    We may need to disclose Personal Information to third parties, such as our related companies or our service providers (for example, IT and administrative service providers and our professional advisors).

10.6    Where we are required by law to report on our activities, you acknowledge that from time to time we may request certain information from you in order to meet our requirements, and you agree to provide us with such information within the timeframes reasonably requested by us.

## 11.     Consumer Law Rights

11.2    If you accept these Terms in Australia, nothing in these Terms should be interpreted to exclude, restrict or modify the application of, or any rights or remedies you may have under, any part of the Australian Consumer Law (as set out in Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)). If our Platform is not ordinarily used for personal, household or domestic use, our liability for a breach of your Consumer Law Rights is limited to either resupplying our Services, or paying the cost of having our Services resupplied.

    (d) our aggregate liability to you for any Liability arising from or in connection with these Terms will be limited to the amount of any Subscription Fees paid by you to us in respect of the supply of the relevant Services to which the Liability relates, or if you do not have a Subscription, to AU$1,000.

We may assign or transfer these Terms to a third party, or transfer any debt owed by you to us to a debt collector or other third party.

15.2    Disputes: Neither we or you may commence court proceedings relating to any dispute, controversy or claim arising from, or in connection with, these Terms (including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination) (Dispute) unless we and you first meet (in good faith) to resolve the Dispute.

We recommend that you make your own investigations in relation to the suitability of those websites. If you purchase goods or services from a third party website linked from our Platform, those goods or services are being provided by that third party, not us. We may receive a benefit (which may include a referral fee or a commission) should you visit certain third party websites through a link on our Platform, or for featuring certain goods or services on our Platform.
